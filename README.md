Project Overview
In modern cities, the bane of daily commute is often unpredictable traffic congestion. With the current infrastructure, traffic light timings are mostly static and don't adapt to real-time traffic conditions. This leads to unnecessary traffic congestion and wastage of time for the daily commuter. Our solution? An intelligent traffic light control system that alters its timings dynamically based on real-time traffic congestion.
